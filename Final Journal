Our first class began with an introduction session where each student had the opportunity to introduce themselves. After the introductions, we were divided into small groups and given the task of exploring the campus to identify various instruments of digital technology. As we moved around, we observed and noted down a range of devices such as fans, lights, computers, biometric systems, cameras, projectors, generators, water dispensers, and even sanitary pad vending machines. As homework, we were also asked to explore how to send emails to multiple people at once using Google Sheets.
In the following class, we discussed the different digital technology instruments we had found during our campus tour. Building on that, the instructor introduced us to the concept of binary numbers. We learned how computers operate using binary code and practiced calculating numbers in binary form. This session gave us a foundational understanding of how digital technology processes information at the most basic level.
Next, the instructor talked about the structure of the course, including the units and assessments we would undertake during the course of the semester. We were introduced to important tools like Git and learned about logic gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. The instructor explained how data flows from the CPU to the LPU, highlighting the role of components like registers and compilers. She also talked about real-world digital issues, such as how network service providers sometimes intentionally reduce network speeds and how hackers exploit vulnerabilities in open Wi-Fi networks.
Following this, we dived deeper into computer architecture. The instructor explained how computation takes place in the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and described the functioning of important internal components like the Address Bus and Data Bus. This understanding paved the way for more complex topics later.
After a few sessions of learning, we had a quiz to test our knowledge of binary numbers. It gave us a clearer understanding of binary calculations.
Moving forward, we installed Linux on our systems. It was an exciting experience as we learned how to operate the Linux system through the command prompt. This hands-on experience gave us a sense of control and familiarity with an alternative operating system beyond Windows.
Continuing our exploration of command-line interfaces, we were introduced to PowerShell. We practiced creating new directories and learned basic commands that are essential for navigating and managing files within the system.
Later, we explored the Linux WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment. We learned basic commands using the pico editor, including how to create and delete directories and use bash commands. Along with this, we discussed the history and features of both Unix and Linux operating systems, gaining a deeper understanding of their significance in the world of computing.
After that, we worked on in-class presentations. Our group presentation focused on Linux. We shared our learnings about its installation, usage, and core features with the rest of the class.
In the next class, the instructor introduced us to more Linux commands using the pico editor. We learned commands like bash, ps-aux, ps-ef, cat, and wc, and also practiced renaming directories. These sessions helped strengthen our command-line skills.
The next class was online. During this online session, we were instructed to install Linux using a USB boot method, further enhancing our hands-on skills with operating systems.
Later, we had a guest lecture where an external speaker deepened our understanding of technology through real-world examples and practical insights.
Afterward, we had a quiz to assess our understanding of shell commands, including the commands and operations we had been practicing over the past few weeks.
As the course progressed, the instructor introduced us to new concepts such as mail climb and basic hardware connections. We learned about the communication between different hardware components and the protocols that make these connections possible.
Continuing with network-related topics, the instructor explained important concepts such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, firewalls, and protocols like HTTP and FTTP. These lessons helped us understand the basics of how information travels over the internet and how security measures are implemented.
In a later class, we had a quiz focused on internet protocols and transmission processes. Following the quiz, we began working with Git inside the WSL environment. We learned how to initialize repositories, add files, and commit changes. Alongside this, we were also taught about the fascinating history, origin, and evolution of the Linux operating system.
Then we had a guest lecture on Artificial Neural Networks by Bhanu Priya. She began by drawing a comparison between biological neurons and artificial neural networks, making it easier for us to grasp the foundational concepts. She then explained how artificial neurons function, introduced us to threshold functions and binary gates, and described various methods of training networks. Additionally, she discussed Hebbâ€™s rule and the limitations of the early McCulloch & Pitts model of neural networks.
As part of our project work, we also gave short presentation. Our group focused on understanding e-commerce platforms, explaining how they operate and the technologies that support them.
Outside of class, we dedicated time to working on our project. These sessions allowed us to collaborate more deeply and refine our presentation.
Finally, we concluded our project work by delivering a formal presentation in front of the instructor. It was a fulfilling experience to showcase everything we had learned and worked on throughout the course.
